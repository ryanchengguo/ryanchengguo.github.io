I'm Ryan Guo and I am a corporation financial analyst working in North Vancouver, BC. I'm teaching myself about computer science and my favorite subject is to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to make further improvement on existing accounting software systems and enterprise resource planning systems.
